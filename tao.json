{"translation":["The way that can be spoken of\nIs not the constant way;\nThe name that can be named\nIs not the constant name.","The nameless was the beginning of heaven and earth;\nThe named was the mother of the myriad creatures.","Hence always rid yourself of desires in order to observe its secrets;\nBut always allow yourself to have desires in order to observe its manifestations.\nThese two are the same\nBut diverge in name as they issue forth.\nBeing the same they are called mysteries,\nMystery upon mystery -\nThe gateway of the manifold secrets.","The whole world recognizes the beautiful as the beautiful, yet this is only the ugly;\nthe whole world recognizes the good as the good, yet this is only the bad.","Thus Something and Nothing produce each other;\nThe difficult and the easy complement each other;\nThe long and the short off-set each other;\nThe high and the low incline towards each other;\nNote and sound harmonize with each other;\nBefore and after follow each other.","Therefore the sage keeps to the deed that consists in taking no action and practices the teaching that uses no words.","The myriad creatures rise from it yet it claims no authority;\nIt gives them life yet claims no possession;\nIt benefits them yet exacts no gratitude;\nIt accomplishes its task yet lays claim to no merit.","It is because it lays claim to no merit\nThat its merit never deserts it.","Not to honor men of worth will keep the people from contention;\nnot to value goods which are hard to come by will keep them from theft;\nnot to display what is desirable will keep them from being unsettled of mind.","Therefore in governing the people, the sage empties their minds but fills their bellies, weakens their wills but strengthens their bones.\nHe always keeps them innocent of knowledge and free from desire, and ensures that the clever never dare to act.","Do that which consists in taking no action, and order will prevail.","The way is empty, yet use will not drain it.\nDeep, it is like the ancestor of the myriad creatures.","Blunt the sharpness;\nUntangle the knots;\nSoften the glare;\nLet your wheels move only along old ruts.","Darkly visible, it only seems as if it were there.\nI know not whose son it is.\nIt images the forefather of God.","Heaven and earth are ruthless, and treat the myriad creatures as straw dogs;\nthe sage is ruthless, and treats the people as straw dogs.","Is not the space between heaven and earth like a bellows?\nIt is empty without being exhausted:\nThe more it works the more comes out.","Much speech leads inevitably to silence.\nBetter to hold fast to the void.","The spirit of the valley never dies.\nThis is called the mysterious female.\nThe gateway of the mysterious female\nIs called the root of heaven and earth.\nDimly visible, it seems as if it were there,\nYet use will never drain it.","Heaven and earth are enduring.\nThe reason why heaven and earth can be enduring is that they do not give themselves life.\nHence they are able to be long-lived.","Therefore the sage puts his person last and it comes first,\nTreats it as extraneous to himself and it is preserved.","Is it not because he is without thought of self that he is able to accomplish his private ends?","Highest good is like water.\nBecause water excels in benefiting the myriad creatures without contending with them and settles where none would like to be, it comes close to the way.","In a home it is the site that matters;\nIn quality of mind it is depth that matters;\nIn an ally it is benevolence that matters;\nIn speech it is good faith that matters;\nIn government it is order that matters;\nIn affairs it is ability that matters;\nIn action it is timeliness that matters.","It is because it does not contend that it is never at fault.","Rather than fill it to the brim by keeping it upright\nBetter to have stopped in time;\nHammer it to a point\nAnd the sharpness cannot be preserved for ever;\nThere may be gold and jade to fill a hall\nBut there is none who can keep them.\nTo be overbearing when one has wealth and position\nIs to bring calamity upon oneself.\nTo retire when the task is accomplished\nIs the way of heaven.","When carrying on your head your perplexed bodily soul\nCan you embrace in your arms the One and not let go?","In concentrating your breath can you become as supple\nAs a babe?","Can you polish your mysterious mirror\nAnd leave no blemish?","Can you love the people and govern the state\nWithout resorting to action?","When the gates of heaven open and shut\nAre you capable of keeping to the role of the female?","When your discernment penetrates the four quarters\nAre you capable of not knowing anything?","It gives them life and rears them.\nIt gives them life yet claims no possession;\nIt benefits them yet exacts no gratitude;\nIt is the steward yet exercises no authority.\nSuch is called the mysterious virtue.","Thirty spokes share one hub.\nAdapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the cart.","Knead clay in order to make a vessel.\nAdapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the vessel.","Cut out doors and windows in order to make a room.\nAdapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the room.","Thus what we gain is Something, yet it is by virtue of Nothing that this can be put to use.","The five colors make man's eyes blind;\nThe five notes make his ears deaf;\nThe five tastes injure his palate;\nRiding and hunting\nMake his mind go wild with excitement;\nGoods hard to come by\nServe to hinder his progress.","Hence the sage is\nFor the belly\nNot for the eye.","Therefore he discards the one and takes the other.","Favor and disgrace are things that startle;\nHigh rank is, like one's body, a source of great trouble.","What is meant by saying favor and disgrace are things that startle?\nFavor when it is bestowed on a subject serves to startle as much as when it is withdrawn.\nThis is what is meant by saying that favor and disgrace are things that startle.","What is meant by saying that high rank is, like one's body, a source of great trouble?\nThe reason I have great trouble is that I have a body.\nWhen I no longer have a body, what trouble have I?","Hence he who values his body more than dominion over the empire can be entrusted with the empire.","He who loves his body more than dominion over the empire can be given the custody of the empire.","What cannot be seen is called evanescent;\nWhat cannot be heard is called rarefied;\nWhat cannot be touched is called minute.\nThese three cannot be fathomed\nAnd so they are confused and looked upon as one.","Its upper part is not dazzling;\nIts lower part is not obscure.\nDimly visible, it cannot be named\nAnd returns to that which is without substance.\nThis is called the shape that has no shape,\nThe image that is without substance.\nThis is called indistinct and shadowy.\nGo up to it and you will not see its head;\nFollow behind it and you will not see its rear.","Hold fast to the way of antiquity\nIn order to keep in control the realm of today.\nThe ability to know the beginning of antiquity\nIs called the thread running through the way.","Of old he who was well versed in the way\nWas minutely subtle, mysteriously comprehending,\nAnd too profound to be known.\nIt is because he could not be known\nThat he can only be given a makeshift description:","Tentative, as if fording a river in winter,\nHesitant, as if in fear of his neighbors;\nFormal like a guest;\nFalling apart like the thawing ice;\nThick like the uncarved block;\nVacant like a valley;\nMurky like muddy water.","Who can be muddy and yet, settling, slowly become limpid?\nWho can be at rest and yet, stirring, slowly come to life?\nHe who holds fast to this way\nDesires not to be full.\nIt is because he is not full\nThat he can be worn and yet newly made.","I do my utmost to attain emptiness;\nI hold firmly to stillness.\nThe myriad creatures all rise together\nAnd I watch their return.\nThe teaming creatures\nAll return to their separate roots.\nReturning to one's roots is known as stillness.\nThis is what is meant by returning to one's destiny.\nReturning to one's destiny is known as the constant.\nKnowledge of the constant is known as discernment.","Woe to him who wilfully innovates\nWhile ignorant of the constant,\nBut should one act from knowledge of the constant\nOne's action will lead to impartiality,\nImpartiality to kingliness,\nKingliness to heaven,\nHeaven to the way,\nThe way to perpetuity,\nAnd to the end of one's days one will meet with no danger.","The best of all rulers is but a shadowy presence to his subjects.\nNext comes the ruler they love and praise;\nNext comes one they fear;\nNext comes one with whom they take liberties.","When there is not enough faith, there is lack of good faith.","Hesitant, he does not utter words lightly.\nWhen his task is accomplished and his work done\nThe people all say, 'It happened to us naturally.'","When the great way falls into disuse\nThere are benevolence and rectitude;\nWhen cleverness emerges\nThere is great hypocrisy;\nWhen the six relations are at variance\nThere are filial children;\nWhen the state is benighted\nThere are loyal ministers.","Exterminate learning and there will no longer be worries.","Exterminate the sage, discard the wise,\nAnd the people will benefit a hundredfold;\nExterminate benevolence, discard rectitude,\nAnd the people will again be filial;\nExterminate ingenuity, discard profit,\nAnd there will be no more thieves and bandits.","These three, being false adornments, are not enough\nAnd the people must have something to which they can attach themselves:\nExhibit the unadorned and embrace the uncarved block,\nHave little thought of self and as few desires as possible.","Between yea and nay\nHow much difference is there?\nBetween good and evil\nHow great is the distance?","What others fear\nOne must also fear.","The multitude are joyous\nAs if partaking of the offering\nOr going up to a terrace in spring.\nI alone am inactive and reveal no signs,\nAnd wax without having reached the limit.\nLike a baby that has not yet learned to smile,\nListless as though with no home to go back to.","The multitude all have more than enough.\nI alone seem to be in want.\nMy mind is that of a fool - how blank!","Vulgar people are clear.\nI alone am drowsy.","Vulgar people are alert.\nI alone am muddled.\nCalm like the sea;\nLike a high wind that never ceases.","The multitude all have a purpose.\nI alone am foolish and uncouth.\nI alone am different from others\nAnd value being fed by the mother.","In his every movement a man of great virtue\nFollows the way and the way only.","As a thing the way is\nShadowy and indistinct.\nIndistinct and shadowy,\nYet within it is an image;\nShadowy and indistinct,\nYet within it is a substance.\nDim and dark,\nYet within it is an essence.\nThis essence is quite genuine\nAnd within it is something that can be tested.","From the present back to antiquity,\nIts name never deserted it.\nIt serves as a means for inspecting the fathers of the multitude.\nHow do I know that the fathers of the multitude are like that?\nBy means of this.","Bowed down then preserved;\nBent then straight;\nHollow then full;\nWorn then new;\nA little then benefited;\nA lot then perplexed.","Therefore the sage embraces the One and is a model for the empire.","He does not show himself, and so is conspicuous;\nHe does not consider himself right, and so is illustrious;\nHe does not brag, and so has merit;\nHe does not boast, and so endures.","It is because he does not contend that no one in the empire is in a position to contend with him.","The way the ancients had it, 'Bowed down then preserved', is no empty saying.\nTruly it enables one to be preserved to the end.","To use words but rarely\nIs to be natural.","Hence a gusty wind cannot last all morning, and a sudden downpour cannot last all day.\nWho is it that produces these? Heaven and earth.\nIf even heaven and earth cannot go on forever, much less can man.\nThat is why one follows the way.","A man of the way conforms to the way;\nA man of virtue conforms to virtue;\nA man of loss conforms to loss.\nHe who conforms to the way is gladly accepted by the way;\nHe who conforms to virtue is gladly accepted by virtue;\nHe who conforms to loss is gladly accepted by loss.","When there is not enough faith, there is lack of good faith.","He who tiptoes cannot stand; he who strides cannot walk.","He who shows himself is not conspicuous;\nHe who considers himself right is not illustrious;\nHe who brags will have no merit;\nHe who boasts will not endure.","From the point of view of the way these are 'excessive food and useless excrescences'.\nAs there are Things that detest them, he who has the way does not abide in them.","There is a thing confusedly formed,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\nSilent and void\nIt stands alone and does not change,\nGoes round and does not weary.\nIt is capable of being the mother of the world.\nI know not its name\nSo I style it 'the way'.","I give it the makeshift name of 'the great'.\nBeing great, it is further described as receding,\nReceding, it is described as far away,\nBeing far away, it is described as turning back.","Hence the way is great;\nHeaven is great;\nEarth is great;\nThe king is also great.\nWithin the realm there are four things that are great,\nAnd the king counts as one.","Man models himself on earth,\nEarth on heaven,\nHeaven on the way,\nAnd the way on that which is naturally so.","The heavy is the root of the light;\nThe still is the lord of the restless.","Therefore the gentleman when travelling all day\nNever lets the heavily laden carts out of his sight.\nIt is only when he is safely behind walls and watch-towers\nThat he rests peacefully and is above worries.\nHow, then, should a ruler of ten thousand chariots\nMake light of his own person in the eyes of the empire?","If light, then the root is lost;\nIf restless, then the lord is lost.","One who excels in travelling leaves no wheel tracks;\nOne who excels in speech makes no slips;\nOne who excels in reckoning uses no counting rods;\nOne who excels in shutting uses no bolts yet what he has shut cannot be opened.\nOne who excels in tying uses no cords yet what he has tied cannot be undone.","Therefore the sage always excels in saving people, and so abandons no one;\nAlways excels in saving things, and so abandons nothing.\nThis is called following one's discernment.","Hence the good man is the teacher the bad learns from;\nAnd the bad man is the material the good works on.\nNot to value the teacher\nNor to love the material\nThough it seems clever, betrays great bewilderment.\nThis is called the essential and the secret.","Know the male\nBut keep to the role of the female\nAnd be a ravine to the empire.\nIf you are a ravine to the empire,\nThen the constant virtue will not desert you\nAnd you will again return to being a babe.","Know the white\nBut keep to the role of the sullied\nAnd be a model to the empire.\nIf you are a model to the empire,\nThen the constant virtue will not be wanting\nAnd you will return to the infinite.","Know honour\nBut keep to the role of the disgraced\nAnd be a valley to the empire.\nIf you are a valley to the empire,\nThen the constant virtue will be sufficient\nAnd you will return to being the uncarved block.","When the uncarved block shatters it becomes vessels.\nThe sage makes use of these and becomes the lord over the officials.\nHence the greatest cutting does not sever.","Whoever takes the empire and wishes to do anything to it I see will have no respite.\nThe empire is a sacred vessel and nothing should be done to it.\nWhoever does anything to it will ruin it;\nwhoever lays hold of it will lose it.","Hence some things lead and some follow;\nSome breathe gently and some breathe hard;\nSome are strong and some are weak;\nSome destroy and some are destroyed.","Therefore the sage avoids excess, extravagance, and arrogance.","One who assists the ruler of men by means of the way does not intimidate the empire by a show of arms.","This is something which is liable to rebound.\nWhere troops have encamped\nThere will brambles grow;\nIn the wake of a mighty army\nBad harvests follow without fail.","One who is good aims only at bringing his campaign to a conclusion and dare not thereby intimidate.\nBring it to a conclusion but do not brag;\nBring it to a conclusion but do not be arrogant;\nBring it to a conclusion but only when there is no choice;\nBring it to a conclusion but do not intimidate.","A creature in its prime doing harm to the old\nIs known as going against the way.","That which goes against the way will come to an early end.","It is because arms are instruments of ill omen and there are Things that detest them that the one who has the way does not abide by their use.\nThe gentleman gives precedence to the left when at home, but to the right when he goes to war.\nArms are instruments of ill omen, not the instruments of the gentleman.\nWhen one is compelled to use them, it is best to do so without relish.","There is no glory in victory, and so to glorify it despite this is to exult in the killing of men.\nOne who exults in the killing of men will never have his way in the empire.","On occasions of rejoicing precedence is given to the left;\nOn occasions of mourning precedence is given to the right.\nA lieutenants place is on the left;\nThe general's place is on the right.\nThis means that it is mourning rites that are observed.\nWhen great numbers of people are killed, one should weep over them with sorrow.\nWhen victorious in war, one should observe the rites of mourning.","The way is for ever nameless.\nThough the uncarved block is small\nNo one in the world dare claim its allegiance.\nShould lords and princes be able to hold fast to it\nThe myriad creatures will submit of their own accord,\nHeaven and earth will unite and sweet dew will fall,\nAnd the people will be equitable, though no one so decrees.","Only when it is cut are there names.\nAs soon as there are names\nOne ought to know that it is time to stop.\nKnowing when to stop one can be free from danger.","The way is to the world as the River and the Sea are to rivulets and streams.","He who knows others is clever;\nHe who knows himself has discernment.","He who overcomes others has force;\nHe who overcomes himself is strong.","He who knows contentment is rich;\nHe who perseveres is a man of purpose;\nHe who does not lose his station will endure;\nHe who lives out his days has had a long life.","The way is broad, reaching left as well as right.\nThe myriad creatures depend on it for life yet it claims no authority.\nIt accomplishes its task yet lays claim to no merit.\nIt clothes and feeds the myriad creatures yet lays no claim to being their master.","For ever free of desire, it can be called small;\nYet as it lays no claim to being master when the myriad creatures turn to it, it can be called great.","It is because it never attempts itself to become great that it succeeds in becoming great.","Have in your hold the great image\nAnd the empire will come to you.\nComing to you and meeting with no harm\nIt will be safe and sound.\nMusic and food\nWill induce the wayfarer to stop.","The way in its passage through the mouth is without flavor.\nIt cannot be seen,\nIt cannot be heard,\nYet it cannot be exhausted by use.","If you would have a thing shrink,\nYou must first stretch it;\nIf you would have a thing weakened,\nYou must first strengthen it;\nIf you would have a thing laid aside,\nYou must first set it up;\nIf you would take from a thing,\nYou must first give to it.","This is called subtle discernment:\nThe submissive and weak will overcome the hard and strong.","The fish must not be allowed to leave the deep;\nThe instruments of power in a state must not be revealed to anyone.","The way never acts, yet nothing is left undone.\nShould lords and princes be able to hold fast to it,\nThe myriad creatures will be transformed of their own accord.\nAfter they are transformed, should desire raise its head,\nI shall press it down with the weight of the nameless uncarved block.","The nameless uncarved block\nIs but freedom from desire,\nAnd if I cease to desire and remain still,\nThe empire will be at peace of its own accord.","A man of the highest virtue does not keep to virtue and that is why he has virtue.\nA man of the lowest virtue never strays from virtue and that is why he is without virtue.","The former never acts yet leaves nothing undone.\nThe latter acts but there are things left undone.","A man of the highest benevolence acts, but from no ulterior motive.\nA man of the highest rectitude acts, but from ulterior motive.\nA man most conversant in the rites acts, but when no one responds rolls up his sleeves and resorts to persuasion by force.","Hence when the way was lost there was virtue;\nWhen virtue was lost there was benevolence;\nWhen benevolence was lost there was rectitude;\nWhen rectitude was lost there were the rites.\nThe rites are the wearing thin of loyalty and good faith\nAnd the beginning of disorder;\nForeknowledge is the flowery embellishment of the way\nAnd the beginning of folly.","Hence the man of large mind abides in the thick not in the thin, in the fruit not in the flower.","Therefore he discards the one and takes the other.","Of old, these came to be in possession of the One:\nHeaven in virtue of the One is limpid;\nEarth in virtue of the One is settled;\nGods in virtue of the One have their potencies;\nThe valley in virtue of the One is full;\nThe myriad creatures in virtue of the One are alive;\nLords and princes in virtue of the One become leaders of the empire.\nIt is the One that makes these what they are.","Without what makes it limpid heaven might split;\nWithout what makes it settled earth might sink;\nWithout what gives them their potencies gods might spend themselves;\nWithout what makes it full the valley might run dry;\nWithout what keeps them alive the myriad creatures might perish;\nWithout what makes them leaders lords and princes might fall.","Hence the superior must have the inferior as root;\nThe high must have the low as base.","Thus lords and princes refer to themselves as 'solitary', 'desolate', and 'hapless'.\nThis is taking the inferior as root, is it not?","Hence the highest renown is without renown,\nNot wishing to be one among many like jade\nNor to be aloof like stone.","Turning back is how the way moves;\nWeakness is the means the way employs.","The myriad creatures in the world are born from\nSomething, and Something from Nothing.","When the best student hears about the way\nHe practices it assiduously;\nWhen the average student hears about the way\nIt seems to him there one moment and gone the next;\nWhen the worst student hears about the way\nHe laughs out loud.\nIf he did not laugh\nIt would be unworthy of being the way.","Hence the Chien yen has it:\nThe way that is bright seems dull;\nThe way that is forward seems to lead backward;\nThe way that is even seems rough.","The highest virtue is like the valley;\nThe sheerest whiteness seems sullied;\nAmple virtue seems defective;\nVigorous virtue seems indolent;\nPlain virtue seems soiled;\nThe great square has no corners.","The great vessel takes long to complete;\nThe great note is rarefied in sound;\nThe great image has no shape.","The way conceals itself in being nameless.","It is the way alone that excels in bestowing and in accomplishing.","The way begets one;\nOne begets two;\nTwo begets three;\nThree begets the myriad creatures.","The myriad creatures carry on their backs the yin and embrace in their arms the yang and are the blending of the generative forces of the two.","There are no words which men detest more than 'solitary', 'desolate', and 'hapless', yet lords and princes use these to refer to themselves.\nThus a thing is sometimes added to by being diminished and diminished by being added to.","What others teach I also teach.\n'The violent shall not come to a natural end.'\nI shall take this as my precept.","Exterminate learning, and there will no longer be worries.","The most submissive thing in the world can ride roughshod over the hardest in the world;\nThat which is without substance entering that which has no crevices.\nThat is why I know the benefit of resorting to no action.\nThe teaching that uses no words, the benefit of resorting to no action, these are beyond the understanding of all but a very few in the world.","Your name or your person,\nWhich is dearer?\nYour person or your goods,\nWhich is worth more?\nGain or loss,\nWhich is a greater bane?\nThat is why excessive meanness\nIs sure to lead to great expense;\nToo much store\nIs sure to end in immense loss.","Know contentment\nAnd you will suffer no disgrace;\nKnow when to stop\nAnd you will meet with no danger.\nYou can then endure.","Great perfection seems chipped,\nYet use will not wear it out;\nGreat fullness seems empty,\nYet use will not drain it;\nGreat straightness seems bent;\nGreat skill seems awkward;\nGreat eloquence seems tongue-tied.","Restlessness overcomes cold;\nStillness overcomes heat.","Limpid and still,\nOne can be a leader in the empire.","When the way prevails in the empire, fleet-footed horses are relegated to ploughing in the fields;\nWhen the way does not prevail in the empire, war-horses breed on the border.","There is no crime greater than having too many desires;\nThere is no disaster greater than not being content;\nThere is no misfortune greater than being covetous.","Hence in being content, one will always have enough.","Without stirring abroad\nOne can know the whole world;\nWithout looking out the window\nOne can see the way of heaven.\nThe further one goes\nThe less one knows.\nTherefore the sage knows without having to stir,\nIdentifies without having to see,\nAccomplishes without having to act.","In the pursuit of learning one knows more every day;\nIn the pursuit of the way one does less every day.\nOne does less and less until one does nothing at all, and when one does nothing at all there is nothing that is undone.","It is always through not meddling that the empire is won.\nShould you meddle, then you are not equal to the task of winning the empire.","The sage has no mind of his own.\nHe takes as his own the mind of the people.","Those who are good I treat as good.\nThose who are not good I also treat as good.\nIn so doing I gain in goodness.\nThose who are of good faith I have faith in.\nThose who are lacking in good faith I also have faith in.\nIn so doing I gain in good faith.","The sage in his attempt to distract the mind of the empire seeks urgently to muddle it.\nThe people all have something to occupy their eyes and ears, and the sage treats them all like children.","When going one way means life and going the other means death, three in ten will be comrades in life, three in ten will be comrades in death, and there are those who value life and as a result move into the realm of death, and these also number three in ten.\nWhy is this so? Because they set too much store by life.","I have heard it said that one who excels in safeguarding his own life does not meet with rhinoceros or tiger when travelling on land nor is he touched by weapons when charging into an army.","There is nowhere for the rhinoceros to pitch its horn;\nThere is nowhere for the tiger to place its claws;\nThere is nowhere for the weapon to lodge its blade.\nWhy is this so? Because for him there is no realm of death.","The way gives them life;\nVirtue rears them;\nThings give them shape;\nCircumstances bring them to maturity.\nTherefore the myriad creatures all revere the way and honor virtue.","Yet the way is revered and virtue honored not because this is decreed by any authority but because it is natural for them to be treated so.\nThus the way gives them life and rears them;\nBrings them up and nurses them;\nBrings them to fruition and maturity;\nFeeds and shelters them.","It gives them life yet claims no possession;\nIt benefits them yet exacts no gratitude;\nIt is the steward yet exercises no authority.\nSuch is called the mysterious virtue.","The world had a beginning\nAnd this beginning could be the mother of the world.\nWhen you know the mother\nGo on to know the child.\nAfter you have known the child\nGo back to holding fast to the mother,\nAnd to the end of your days you will not meet with danger.","Block the openings,\nShut the doors,\nAnd all your life you will not run dry.\nUnblock the openings,\nAdd to your troubles,\nAnd to the end of your days you will be beyond salvation.","To see the small is called discernment;\nTo hold fast to the submissive is called strength.\nUse the light\nBut give up the discernment.\nBring not misfortune upon yourself.\nThis is known as following the constant.","Were I possessed of the least knowledge, I would, when walking on the great way, fear only paths that lead astray.\nThe great way is easy, yet people prefer by-paths.","The court is corrupt,\nThe fields are overgrown with weeds,\nThe granaries are empty;\nYet there are those dressed in fineries,\nWith swords at their sides,\nFilled with food and drink,\nAnd possessed of too much wealth.\nThis is known as taking the lead in robbery.\nFar indeed is this from the way.","What is firmly rooted cannot be pulled out;\nWhat is tightly held in the arms will not slip loose;\nThrough this the offering of sacrifice by descendants will never come to an end.","Cultivate it in your person\nAnd its virtue will be genuine;\nCultivate it in the family\nAnd its virtue will be more than sufficient;\nCultivate it in the hamlet\nAnd its virtue will endure;\nCultivate it in the state\nAnd its virtue will abound;\nCultivate it in the empire\nAnd its virtue will be pervasive.","Hence look at the person through the person;\nLook at the family through the family;\nLook at the hamlet through the hamlet;\nLook at the state through the state;\nLook at the empire through the empire.\nHow do I know that the empire is like that?\nBy means of this.","One who possesses virtue in abundance is comparable to a new born babe:\nPoisonous insects will not sting it;\nFerocious animals will not pounce on it;\nPredatory birds will not swoop down on it.\nIts bones are weak and its sinews supple yet its hold is firm.","It does not know the union of male and female yet its male member will stir:\nThis is because its virility is at its height.","It howls all day yet does not become hoarse:\nThis is because its harmony is at its height.","To know harmony is called the constant;\nTo know the constant is called discernment.","To try to add to one's vitality is called ill-omened;\nFor the mind to egg on the breath is called violent.","A creature in its prime doing harm to the old\nIs known as going against the way.\nThat which goes against the way will come to an early end.","One who knows does not speak;\nOne who speaks does not know.","Block the openings;\nShut the doors.\nBlunt the sharpness;\nUntangle the knots;\nSoften the glare;\nLet your wheels move only along old ruts.\nThis is known as mysterious sameness.","Hence you cannot get close to it, nor can you keep it at arm's length;\nYou cannot bestow benefit on it, nor can you do it harm;\nYou cannot ennoble it, nor can you debase it.\nTherefore it is valued by the empire.","Govern the state by being straightforward;\nWage war by being crafty;\nBut win the empire by not being meddlesome.\nHow do I know that it is like that?\nBy means of this.","The more taboos there are in the empire\nThe poorer the people;\nThe more sharpened tools the people have\nThe more benighted the state;\nThe more skills the people have\nThe further novelties multiply;\nThe better known the laws and edicts\nThe more thieves and robbers there are.","Hence the sage says,\nI take no action and the people are transformed of themselves;\nI prefer stillness and the people are rectified of themselves;\nI am not meddlesome and the people prosper of themselves;\nI am free from desire and the people of themselves become simple like the uncarved block.","When the government is muddled\nThe people are simple;\nWhen the government is alert\nThe people are cunning.","It is on disaster that good fortune perches;\nIt is beneath good fortune that disaster crouches.","Who knows the limit? Does not the straightforward exist?\nThe straightforward changes again into the crafty, and the good changes again into the monstrous.\nIndeed, it is long since the people were perplexed.","Therefore the sage is square-edged but does not scrape,\nHas corners but does not jab,\nExtends himself but not at the expense of others,\nShines but does not dazzle.","In ruling the people and in serving heaven it is best for a ruler to be sparing.\nIt is because he is sparing\nThat he may be said to follow the way from the start;\nFollowing the way from the start he may be said to accumulate an abundance of virtue;\nAccumulating an abundance of virtue there is nothing he cannot overcome;","When there is nothing he cannot overcome, no one knows his limit;\nWhen no one knows his limit\nHe can possess a state;\nWhen he possesses the mother of a state\nHe can then endure.","This is called the way of deep roots and firm stems by which one lives to see many days.","Governing a large state is like boiling a small fish.","When the empire is ruled in accordance with the way,\nThe spirits lose their potencies.\nOr rather, it is not that they lose their potencies,\nBut that, though they have their potencies, they do not harm the people.\nIt is not only they who, having their potencies, do not harm the people,\nThe sage, also, does not harm the people.\nAs neither does any harm, each attributes the merit to the other.","A large state is the lower reaches of a river:\nThe place where all the streams of the world unite.","In the union of the world,\nThe female always gets the better of the male by stillness.\nBeing still, she takes the lower position.","Hence the large state, by taking the lower position, annexes the small state;\nThe small state, by taking the lower position, affiliates itself to the large state.\nThus the one, by taking the lower position, annexes;\nThe other, by taking the lower position, is annexed.","All that the large state wants is to take the other under its wing;\nAll that the small state wants is to have its services accepted by the other.\nIf each of the two wants to find its proper place,\nIt is meet that the large should take the lower position.","The way is the refuge for the myriad creatures.\nIt is that by which the good man protects,\nAnd that by which the bad is protected.","Beautiful words when offered will win high rank in return;\nBeautiful deeds can raise a man above others.","Even if a man is not good, why should he be abandoned?","Hence when the emperor is set up and the three ducal ministers are appointed, he who makes a present of the way without stirring from his seat is preferable to one who offers presents of jade disks followed by a team of four horses.","Why was this way valued of old?\nWas it not said that by means of it one got what one wanted and escaped the consequences when one transgressed?\nTherefore it is valued by the empire.","Do that which consists in taking no action;\nPursue that which is not meddlesome;\nSavor that which has no flavor.","Make the small big and the few many;\nDo good to him who has done you an injury.","Lay plans for the accomplishment of the difficult before it becomes difficult;\nMake something big by starting with it when small.","Difficult things in the word must needs have their beginnings in the easy;\nBig things must needs have their beginnings in the small.","Therefore it is because the sage never attempts to be great that he succeeds in becoming great.","One who makes promises rashly rarely keeps good faith;\nOne who is in the habit of considering things easy meets with frequent difficulties.\nTherefore even the sage treats some things as difficult.\nThat is why in the end no difficulties can get the better of him.","It is easy to maintain a situation while it is still secure;\nIt is easy to deal with a situation before symptoms develop;\nIt is easy to break a thing when it is yet brittle;\nIt is easy to dissolve a thing when it is yet minute.","Deal with a thing while it is still nothing;\nKeep a thing in order before disorder sets in.","A tree that can fill the span of a man's arms\nGrows from a downy tip;\nA terrace nine storeys high\nRises from hodfuls of earth;\nA journey of a thousand miles\nStarts from beneath one's feet.","Whoever does anything to it will ruin it;\nWhoever lays hold of it will lose it.","Therefore the sage, because he does nothing, never ruins anything;\nAnd, because he does not lay hold of anything, loses nothing.","In their enterprises the people\nAlways ruin them when on the verge of success.\nBe as careful at the end as at the beginning\nAnd there will be no ruined enterprises.","Therefore the sage desires not to desire\nAnd does not value goods which are hard to come by;\nLearns to be without learning\nAnd makes good the mistakes of the multitude\nIn order to help the myriad creatures to be natural and to refrain from daring to act.","Of old those who excelled in the pursuit of the way did not use it to enlighten the people but to hoodwink them.\nThe reason why the people are difficult to govern is that they are too clever.","Hence to rule a state by cleverness\nWill be to the detriment of the state;\nNot to rule a state by cleverness\nWill be a boon to the state.\nThese two are models.\nAlways to know the models\nIs known as mysterious virtue.","Mysterious virtue is profound and far-reaching,\nBut when things turn back it turns back with them.\nOnly then is complete conformity realized.","The reason why the River and the Sea are able to be king of the hundred valleys is that they excel in taking the lower position.\nHence they are able to be king of the hundred valleys.","Therefore, desiring to rule over the people,\nOne must in one's words humble oneself before them;\nAnd, desiring to lead the people,\nOne must, in one's person, follow behind them.\nTherefore the sage takes his place over the people yet is no burden;\ntakes his place ahead of the people yet causes no obstruction.\nThat is why the empire supports him joyfully and never tires of doing so.","It is because he does not contend that no one in the empire is in a position to contend with him.","The whole world says that my way is vast and resembles nothing.\nIt is because it is vast that it resembles nothing.\nIf it resembled anything, it would, long before now, have become small.","I have three treasures\nWhich I hold and cherish.\nThe first is known as compassion,\nThe second is known as frugality,\nThe third is known as not daring to take the lead in the empire;\nBeing compassionate one could afford to be courageous,\nBeing frugal one could afford to extend one's territory,\nNot daring to take the lead in the empire one could afford to be lord over the vessels.","Now, to forsake compassion for courage, to forsake frugality for expansion, to forsake the rear for the lead, is sure to end in death.","Through compassion, one will triumph in attack and be impregnable in defence.\nWhat heaven succours it protects with the gift of compassion.","One who excels as a warrior does not appear formidable;\nOne who excels in fighting is never roused in anger;\nOne who excels in defeating his enemy does not join issue;\nOne who excels in employing others humbles himself before them.","This is known as the virtue of non-contention;\nThis is known as making use of the efforts of others;\nThis is known as matching the sublimity of heaven.","The strategists have a saying,\nI dare not play the host but play the guest,\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot instead.","This is known as marching forward when there is no road,\nRolling up one's sleeves when there is no arm,\nDragging one's adversary by force when there is no adversary,\nAnd taking up arms when there are no arms.","There is no disaster greater than taking on an enemy too easily.\nSo doing nearly cost me my treasure.\nThus of two sides raising arms against each other,\nIt is the one that is sorrow-stricken that wins.","My words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice,\nYet no one in the world can understand them or put them into practice.","Words have an ancestor and affairs have a sovereign.","It is because people are ignorant that they fail to understand me.\nThose who understand me are few;\nThose who harm me are honoured.","Therefore the sage, while clad in homespun, conceals on his person a priceless piece of jade.","To know yet to think that one does not know is best;\nNot to know yet to think that one knows will lead to difficulty.\nIt is by being alive to difficulty that one can avoid it.\nThe sage meets with no difficulty.\nIt is because he is alive to it that he meets with no difficulty.","When the people lack a proper sense of awe, then some awful visitation will descend upon them.","Do not constrict their living space;\nDo not press down on their means of livelihood.\nIt is because you do not press down on them that they will not weary of the burden.","Hence the sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nLoves himself but does not exalt himself.","Therefore he discards the one and takes the other.","He who is fearless in being bold will meet with his death;\nHe who is fearless in being timid will stay alive.\nOf the two, one leads to good, the other to harm.","Heaven hates what it hates,\nWho knows the reason why?","Therefore even the sage treats some things as difficult.","The way of heaven\nExcels in overcoming though it does not contend,\nIn responding though it does not speak,\nIn attracting though it does not summon,\nIn laying plans though it appears slack.","The net of heaven is cast wide.\nThough the mesh is not fine, yet nothing ever slips through.","When the people are not afraid of death, wherefore frighten them with death?","Were the people always afraid of death, and were I able to arrest and put to death those who innovate, then who would dare?","There is a regular executioner whose charge it is to kill.\nTo kill on behalf of the executioner is what is described as chopping wood on behalf of the master carpenter.\nIn chopping wood on behalf of the master carpenter, there are few who escape hurting their own hands instead.","The people are hungry:\nIt is because those in authority eat up too much in taxes\nThat the people are hungry.","The people are difficult to govern.\nIt is because those in authority are too fond of action\nThat the people are difficult to govern.","The people treat death lightly:\nIt is because the people set too much store by life\nThat they treat death lightly.","It is just because one has no use for life that one is wiser than the man who values life.","A man is supple and weak when living, but hard and stiff when dead.\nGrass and trees are pliant and fragile when living, but dried and shrivelled when dead.\nThus the hard and the strong are the comrades of death;\nThe supple and the weak are the comrades of life.","Therefore a weapon that is strong will not vanquish;\nA tree that is strong will suffer the axe.\nThe strong and big takes the lower position,\nThe supple and weak takes the higher position.","Is not the way of heaven like the stretching of a bow?\nThe high it presses down,\nThe low it lifts up;\nThe excessive it takes from,\nThe deficient it gives to.","It is the way of heaven to take from what has in excess in order to make good what is deficient.\nThe way of man is otherwise: it takes from those who are in want in order to offer this to those who already have more than enough.\nWho is there that can take what he himself has in excess and offer this to the empire?\nOnly he who has the way.","Therefore the sage benefits them yet exacts no gratitude,\nAccomplishes his task yet lays claim to no merit.\nIs this not because he does not wish to be considered a better man than others?","In the world there is nothing more submissive and weak than water.\nYet for attacking that which is hard and strong nothing can surpass it.\nThis is because there is nothing that can take its place.","That the weak overcomes the strong,\nAnd the submissive overcomes the hard,\nEveryone in the world knows yet no one can put this knowledge into practice.","Therefore the sage says,\nOne who takes on himself the humiliation of the state\nIs called a ruler worthy of offering sacrifices to the gods of earth and millet.\nOne who takes on himself the calamity of the state\nIs called a king worthy of dominion over the entire empire.","Straightforward words seem paradoxical.","When peace is made between great enemies,\nSome enmity is bound to remain undispelled.\nHow can this be considered perfect?","Therefore the sage takes the left-hand tally, but exacts no payment from the people.\nThe man of virtue takes charge of the tally;\nThe man of no virtue takes charge of exaction.","It is the way of heaven to show no favoritism.\nIt is for ever on the side of the good man.","Reduce the size of the population and the state.\nEnsure that even though the people have tools of war for a troop or a battalion they will not use them;\nAnd also that they will be reluctant to move to distant places because they look on death as no light matter.","Even when they have ships and carts, they will have no use for them;\nAnd even when they have armor and weapons, they will have no occasion to make a show of them.","Bring it about that the people will return to the use of the knotted rope,\nWill find relish in their food\nAnd beauty in their clothes,\nWill be content in their abode\nAnd happy in the way they live.","Though adjoining states are within sight of one another,\nAnd the sound of dogs barking and cocks crowing in one state can be heard in another,\nyet the people of one state will grow old and die without having had any dealings with those of another.","Truthful words are not beautiful;\nBeautiful words are not truthful.\nGood words are not persuasive;\nPersuasive words are not good.\nHe who knows has no wide learning;\nHe who has wide learning does not know.","The sage does not hoard.\nHaving bestowed all he has on others, he has yet more;\nHaving given all he has to others, he is richer still.","The way of heaven benefits and does not harm;\nThe way of the sage is bountiful and does not contend."]}
